# MoodLogger-Application-Spring-Boot
This is a work-in-progress Moodlogger journal application built using Spring Boot. The backend is fully functional with features like authentication and authorization already implemented to ensure secure access to journal entries. Users can create, update, view, and delete their own journal entries through the API endpoints, also in-memeory cache is implemented in order to retrieve the frequently used data with least latency possible. Currently, the project does not include a frontend UI, it is focused on building a robust and secure backend micro-service.
